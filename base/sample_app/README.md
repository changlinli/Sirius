sample\_app Directory README
============================

This directory contains all the files (except this README) which are extracted
and given to a user upon first running `setup.php`. When developing these files
it is important to make sure that these files can run AS IS with minimal
tweaking from the user. If interaction is required, it is best to be able to
structure that interaction so that it can be prompted to the user on his/her web
browser upon running the welcome screen.
